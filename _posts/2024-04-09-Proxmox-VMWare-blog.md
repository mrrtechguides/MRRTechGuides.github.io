### Enterprise Virtualization
Enterprise virtualization is essential for businesses due to its ability to optimize resource usage, reduce costs, and enhance agility. By creating virtual versions of physical hardware, such as servers and storage devices, virtualization allows for the simultaneous operation of multiple applications and workloads on a single physical server or cluster of servers. This maximizes hardware utilization, lowers hardware procurement and maintenance costs, and enables rapid scaling to meet changing business demands. Additionally, virtualization facilitates efficient disaster recovery, centralized management, improved security through isolation, and streamlined testing and development processes, making it a foundational technology for modern IT infrastructures.
  
Enterprise virtualization solutions often entail significant investments. However, within the Linux ecosystem, businesses can find cost-effective or even free options tailored to their needs, such as [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/). Proxmox is an open-source virtualization platform developed by Proxmox Server Solutions GmbH. It integrates Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) for robust virtual machines and Linux Containers (LXC) for lightweight containerization. Offering features like centralized management, high availability, live migration, backup, and monitoring, Proxmox delivers a comprehensive solution for enterprise virtualization. Its intuitive web-based management interface simplifies deployment, administration, and monitoring of virtualized environments. As a result, Proxmox is widely adopted by organizations of varying sizes seeking efficient and budget-friendly virtualization solutions.

In this guide we will outline the process to install this solution within a linux environment. In order to install this solution the business will need to invest in a server with specific system requirements. You can find the requirements [here](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-virtual-environment/requirements).

#### Download Proxmox ISO Image
Go to https://www.proxmox.com/en/downloads to download the iso image for the solution Proxmox VE. Mount this image to the server and in the hardware boot options select this image. During startup, the image will initialize the solution setup.
